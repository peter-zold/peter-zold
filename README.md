 I just love to dive into an exciting subject, face challenges, solve interesting problems. Luckily, in the world of data, I have so many opportunities to do that. 
So i've done several data analytics and science projects on various subjects, you can find my growing list of works here:

I've also created a school schedule maker with a friend of mine.
The program takes as input a subject allocation and as output a ready-made timetable for a whole school, which meets the predefined constraints and expectations. The engine inside is a genetic algorithm.
It's written in Java, and and we're constantly developing it:
