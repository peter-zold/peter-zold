# Hi, I'm Peter
A data enthusiast, especially interested in data analytics and data science.

## Projects
I just love to dive into an exciting subject, face challenges, solve interesting problems. Luckily, in the world of data, I have so many opportunities to do that.
You can find my growing list of projects here:

I've also created a school schedule maker with a friend written in Java, and we're constantly developing it:
